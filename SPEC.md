# Technical Specification

## System Overview
The system is designed to securely manage and process sensitive data through encryption and decryption mechanisms. The primary purpose is to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data by employing robust cryptographic practices. The main components include frontend interfaces for user interaction, backend services for data processing, a secure database for storing encrypted data, and external APIs for additional functionalities. The system relies heavily on the `crypto.key` for encryption and decryption operations.

## Core Functionality
### 1. Cryptographic Key Management
- **Importance Score: 100**
- **Description:** The system utilizes a cryptographic key stored in the `crypto.key` file for all encryption and decryption processes. This key is Base64-encoded and must be securely managed.
- **Functions:**
  - `load_crypto_key(file_path: str) -> bytes`: Loads and decodes the Base64-encoded key from the file.
  - `encrypt_data(data: str, key: bytes) -> str`: Encrypts the given data using the provided key.
  - `decrypt_data(encrypted_data: str, key: bytes) -> str`: Decrypts the given encrypted data using the provided key.

### 2. Data Encryption Service
- **Importance Score: 90**
- **Description:** This service handles the encryption of sensitive data before storage and decryption upon retrieval. It interacts directly with the cryptographic key.
- **Functions:**
  - `encrypt_sensitive_data(data: str) -> str`: Encrypts sensitive data using the cryptographic key.
  - `decrypt_sensitive_data(encrypted_data: str) -> str`: Decrypts sensitive data using the cryptographic key.

### 3. Key Rotation Mechanism
- **Importance Score: 85**
- **Description:** Implements a policy for periodic key rotation to enhance security. Ensures a smooth transition between old and new keys.
- **Functions:**
  - `generate_new_key() -> bytes`: Generates a new cryptographic key.
  - `rotate_key(old_key: bytes, new_key: bytes) -> None`: Rotates the key, re-encrypting data with the new key where necessary.

### 4. Access Control
- **Importance Score: 80**
- **Description:** Restricts access to the cryptographic key and sensitive data to authorized services and personnel using role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Functions:**
  - `check_access(user_role: str, required_role: str) -> bool`: Checks if the user has the required role to access the key or data.
  - `log_access_attempt(user_id: str, action: str, success: bool) -> None`: Logs access attempts for auditing purposes.

### 5. Key Usage Monitoring
- **Importance Score: 75**
- **Description:** Monitors the usage of the cryptographic key to detect any unauthorized or anomalous activities.
- **Functions:**
  - `log_encryption_event(data_id: str, user_id: str) -> None`: Logs an encryption event.
  - `log_decryption_event(data_id: str, user_id: str) -> None`: Logs a decryption event.
  - `detect_anomalies(logs: List[dict]) -> List[dict]`: Analyzes logs to detect any suspicious patterns.

## Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture where each component is responsible for a specific functionality. Data flows from the frontend to the backend services, where it is processed and stored in the database. The cryptographic key is managed by a dedicated key management service.

### Data Flow
1. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the frontend to input or request sensitive data.
2. **Data Encryption:** The frontend sends the data to the backendâ€™s data encryption service.
3. **Key Loading:** The encryption service loads the cryptographic key using the `load_crypto_key` function.
4. **Encryption Process:** The data is encrypted using the `encrypt_data` function and stored in the database.
5. **Data Retrieval:** When data is requested, the decryption service retrieves the encrypted data from the database.
6. **Decryption Process:** The data is decrypted using the `decrypt_data` function and sent back to the frontend.
7. **Key Rotation:** Periodically, the key rotation mechanism generates a new key and transitions the encryption process to the new key.
8. **Access Control:** All access to the key and data is controlled and logged through the access control functions.
9. **Monitoring:** Usage of the key is continuously monitored for any anomalies.
